QUESTIONS:

Q1: Considering the data provided, explain the need to standardize the attribute values.
R1: The attributes have different ranges and scales. Hence, there is the need to standardize in order to deal with every feature uniformly.



Q2: Explain how you calculated the parameters for standardization and how you used them in the test set.
R2: The parameters are calculated using the examples in the training set. For each column (feature), we compute the mean and the stdev of that column over all the examples. The same parameters are then used to standardize the test set.


Q3: Explain how you calculated the prior probability of an example belonging to a class (the probability before taking into account the attribute values ​​of the example) in your Naïve Bayes classifier implementation. You may include a relevant piece of your code if this helps you explain.
R3: We separated the training data (X, after shuffling) into 2 matrices: X0, those who have class = 0, and X1, the others. The probabilities are then obtained from the number of lines of each matrix:   probs = (len(X0)/len(X), len(X1/len(X)))


Q4: Explain how your Naïve Bayes classifier predicts the class to which a test example belongs. You may include a relevant piece of your code if this helps you explain.
R4: For an example x = (x1,x2,...,xn), it computes 2 joint probability estimates: p0 = p(x1,x2,...,xn,C=0) and p1 = p(x1,x2,...,xn,C=1). The predicted class corresponds to the one which maximizes the joint probability. To compute each estimate, 


Q5: Explain the effect of the bandwidth parameter on your classifier.
R5: 


Q6: Explain what effect the gamma parameter has on the SVM classifier.
R6:


Q7: Explain how you determined the best bandwidth and gamma parameters for your classifier and the SVM classifier. You may include a relevant piece of your code if this helps you explain.
R7:


Q8: Explain how you obtained the best hypothesis for each classifier after optimizing all parameters.
R8: 


Q9: Show the best parameters, the estimate of the true error for each hypothesis you obtained (your classifier and the two provided by the library), the ranges in the expected number of errors given by the approximate normal test, the McNemar test values, and discuss what you can conclude from this.
R9:


Q10: (Optional) Show the estimate of the true error of the optimized SVM classifier (if you did the optional part of the work) and discuss whether it was worth doing this optimization. If you did not do the optional part leave this answer blank.
R10:
